List:

1) SetProjectionMatrix() - Input parameters '0.1' and '20' may need tweaking.
2) All Matrices - Possibly incorrect in regards to syntax (* pointer mode)
3) InitializeConstantBuffers(GSConstantDataMatrices* constData): Possibly incorrect in regards to the pointer (&, perhaps?)
4) CreateTriangleData - Might need the original TriangleVertexStruct rather than a copy.
5) Geometry.hlsl	- float3 halfXYZ might need to be float (It's gonna be a vector)
