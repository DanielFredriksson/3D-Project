- add hr result check things (error box) in the initializations part, when creating different buffers

- So, I need to build it so that there are no pointers in the struct that is getting packaged
and sent to the vertex buffer. Instead, I want an array of the actual struct, and send that in.
So I need to build another struct with all the pointers and shit, including the indices and the
vertex count.

Think back to the triangle data, it was an array on the outside, and then filled with data depending
on how long the array was; syntax wise it had to be what I have to implement.
